Assorted code that doesn't have a home.

Some of it is just testing snippets which happen to be of minor interest or may be useful later.

Others are (temporarily?) abandoned experiments, e.g. with algorithms and data structures.

Very little of it is drop-in, being excised out of other code files and what not.

A little of it comes from [Icebreakers](https://github.com/XibalbaStudios/TacoShell) and more of it from
the pre-Unity [MilitAnt](https://github.com/XibalbaStudios/Marabunta) code base. I was camping on [a lot
of it](https://bitbucket.org/ggcrunchy/luaofinterest) because of all the Havok (née Vision) SDK code, but
now that [Project Anarchy](http://www.projectanarchy.com) is out there's nothing much to hide. Ideally,
those two repositories would be fleshed out with this stuff, and / or I'll incorporate it back into [Hate
the State](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/HateTheState).

(The other stuff in the Lua of Interest repo ought to be mostly functional, but uses a rather poor pre-5.2
module style; the idea behind [Tektite](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/Tektite) is to bring much of that up
to date, but that will be quite time-consuming and I mean to dovetail the effort with some application.)

Whatever else is there has mostly been from [Corona](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/corona-sdk-snippets) or
[LuaJIT](https://github.com/ggcrunchy/LittleGreenMen) experimentation.
